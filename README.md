i use this, to manage my life and write all the  things down, that happened to me (Like you go to a Therapist and tell them your problems).
and i needed a place where i can save this things and bring my feelings to the world.


please be nice and have fun, reading the code. (its not perfekt, and has for a "normmal" language 100 errors.
please do not hate me for the "destroying" any of the Other programmatic languages

RoZe has Java and HTML elements inside, (HTML is for Define, wich part of my characters are active for this action) and Java is for the IfÂ´s, DoÂ´s, and WhileÂ´s

and the rest is my Language "RoZe"

the HTML  elements Symbolizes the Existence of the YuukiSystems Characters i try to add this to every File that i make Specically for every Character:

Example:



<YuukiSystems>
<Lampi>
<script type="text/RoZe">

method 1 to write  the "RoZe" language

{
var Human = "one of the 1000000000 peoople out there"
var Hi = "a hello"
if YuukiSystems See "Human" do Event(Say "Hi")

while wait for Response
}

</script>



Method 2 Write the "Roze" language

The "Line:" Option Shows wich Line of code in the Chosen file is active for this "Event()"
(see by "var" the Partition-path)

<script type="text/RoZe">


var Music = "L:/YuukiSystems/Databases/MusicDatabase/Line:Random"


if YuukiSystems do Event(Listen "Music")

do WhiteRose Event(Set Status = 2)

</script>


enjoy my Life and learn OwO
