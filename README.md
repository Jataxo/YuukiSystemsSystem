and i needed a place where i can save this things and bring my feelings to the world. 


please be nice and have fun, reading the code. (its not perfekt, and has for a "normmal" language 100 errors
please do not hate me for the "destroying" of the programmatic language

Roze is a Mix of Java and HTML

the HTML  elements Symbolizes the Existence of the YuukiSystems Characters i try to add this to every File that i make Specically for every Character:

Example:


<YuukiSystems>
<Lampi>
<script type="text/RoZe">

method 1 to write  the "RoZe" language

{
var Human = "one of the 1000000000 peoople out there"
var Hi = "a hello"
if YuukiSystems See "Human" do Event(Say "Hi")

while wait for Response
}

</script>

Method 2 Write the "Roze" language

<script type="text/RoZe">

var Heart Beats Per Minute = "HBPM"
var Pulse = "PSE"
var Blood Cirkulation = "BC"
var Feelings = "Feelings"
var SetSoulFree = "SSF"

Status(0 = Dead)
Status(1 = Normal)
Status(2 = Happy)
Status(3 = Fear)
Status(4 = Depressed)
Status(5 = angry)
Status(6 = sad)
Status(420 = High)
Status(69 = Adrenalin)
